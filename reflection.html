                So far it's coming along great. I decided to make my website from scratch using HTML and CSS code. I feel the layout could use a little more touching up 
                but the color scheme I am quite fond of. My fonts and colors are easy to read. I made sure to pick that is easy on the eyes.

                What I have learned so far is how to make a website using html and css coding. I made both the home page and the reflections page in two seperate html files. 
                They share the same styling which is another .css file. My only quesiton I have is that I hope you don't mind if the url I use isn't an official or very 
                professional-like. The diffecult aspect so far is trying to add other elements to website. Another difficult element is getting the webite published. But I'll 
                figure all of that out by project 4. I've been using my old HTML stuff from when I took computer science in high school. I have also been using W2 schools for more 
                info. I use termial to open my website for testing and I use VSCode for coding the website.
