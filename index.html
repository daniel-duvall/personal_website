                Hello! My name is Daniel DuVall. I am currently a student at the University of Central Florida. I'm in my second year and I am majoring in Computer Science. 
                Relevent coursework that I have completed includes; Intro to Progromming with C, Computer Logic and Organization, Computer Science I, Computer Scinec II, 
                Object Oriented Programming, Intro to Discrete Mathematics, and Systems Software. These classes have helped exponentially develop my programming skills and 
                equip me with a great sense of logic when it comes to solving complex problems. Currently I am working as a private tutor for a company called Grade Potential
                Tutoring which has taught me a lot when it comes to instructing others and creating unique lesson plans for each of my students. I also used to be a manager 
                at Tropical Smoothie Cafe. That job taught me how to work well with others and how to properly multitask. As a manager I was in charge of everything. I had 
                to make sure everyone was doing the right thing, orders were being made properly, and customers were taken care of.
